 Utilizing the ESP8266 microcontroller, the system integrates multiple 
sensors, including a DHT11 for monitoring room temperature and humidity, a 
DS18B20 for body temperature measurement, and a heartbeat sensor for heart rate 
monitoring. The measured data is displayed locally on an LCD screen and transmitted 
to a cloud-based platform via the Blynk application, enabling remote monitoring 
through smartphones or web interfaces. 
To enhance usability, the system incorporates a local web server for real-time data 
visualization and alert generation. Alerts are triggered for abnormal readings, such 
as elevated or low body temperatures and irregular heart rates, ensuring prompt 
attention.
